    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; color: #FFFFFF">About Agent Based Models</h2>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      The term agent-based model (ABM) can be used to describe any model that leverages individual autonomous elements called agents. Depending on what is being modeled, agents can represent a wide variety of things. For example, in this model, the agents are landowners with either low, medium, or high willingness to sell their property. That said, there are examples of agents representing predator and prey species, vehicles in traffic, economic actors, and so much more (Wilensky and Reisman 2006, Bonabeau 2002)!
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      Because ABMs allow for agents to interact both with each other and with their environment, these types of models can be particularly useful for answering questions about complex systems or scenarios. For example, ABMs have been used to investigate which methods of boarding an aircraft are most efficient (Iyigunlu et al. 2014). On the surface, the question might not seem so complex, but given the amount of different ways passengers could board (e.g., back-to-front, random, window-to-aisle, and so on), comparing between options is likely not so straightforward. If we add to this the fact that the environment (i.e., aisle space) could be a major determining factor and that there could be a wide variety of behaviors and baggage storage needs across passengers, it becomes clearer just how difficult it could be to compare between methods in a realistic way.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      In this aircraft example, the agents are the passengers tasked with loading their baggage and finding their seats. The environment can be understood as the aisle and seats. These environment elements indicate how and where the agents can move. If the aisle is narrow, we might implement an agent-to-agent interaction rule such that passengers may not move through another passenger. Additionally, we might assign different passengers varying overhead luggage loading times. Given how many factors could influence a single model run, we would likely want to run the simulation many times for each boarding method to ensure our conclusions were not skewed by outliers.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      As indicated earlier on, the model found on this page is not about airplane boarding, but I do think that the airplane example provides a useful frame of reference for thinking about ABMs!
    </p>

    <!-- Section about this model -->
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; color: #FFFFFF">About the Land Change Model</h2>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      Importantly, the current iteration of this land change model is a toy model built for exploring how the distribution of development and agents across the environment could affect the speed and shape of development. The model has not yet been calibrated using real world data, but I hope it provides a useful introduction to ABMs and the topic of rural-to-urban land change.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      In this model, the agents are landowners with either low, medium, or high willingness-to-sell their property. Landowners with low willingness-to-sell are marked in blue, landowners with medium willingness-to-sell are marked in yellow, and landowners with high willingness-to-sell are marked in red. The environment can take only one of two states: developed (indicated by gray) or undeveloped (indicated by green). Landowner agents may only inhabit undeveloped cells.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      Each time step in the model represents one year. In each time step, agents are presented with a decision to either retain their property or sell it to a developer. All agent types have been assigned a low base willingness-to-sell of 0.1%. However, I allow proximity to development to dramatically shift this. For each developed cell directly adjacent to an agent, the agent’s willingness-to-sell increases. Agents with high-willingness to sell are twice as sensitive to development as agents with medium willingness-to-sell. Similarly, agents with medium willingness-to-sell are twice as sensitive to development as agents with low willingness-to-sell.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      The inclusion of agent sensitivity to nearby development was largely informed by a research paper from Koch et al. that similarly used neighboring spatial proximity as a proxy for peer influence in an ABM (Koch et al. 2019). Other publications have also indicated that social factors such as social interaction and knowledge transfer can influence individuals’ decision making around land management (Little and McDonald 2007, Schlüter et al. 2017). Importantly, as noted in the paper from Koch et al., “peer-influence is not necessarily defined by geographic space, [but] immediate neighbors can have a particularly strong effect on decisions when it comes to land management” (Koch et al. 2019).
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      The model also allows for random assignments of development and agent distribution. Two types of random assignment are provided: random uniform (labeled “random”) and spatially dependent random noise (labeled “cluster”). The spatially dependent noise assignments are derived from an application of the 2D Perlin noise function. Perlin noise was originally developed by Ken Perlin to procedurally generate textures for the movie Tron in the early 1980s (Shiffman 2015), but, as illustrated by the model, it can be used with success to develop randomly generated spatially dependent patterns of clustering across a grid of cells.

    <!-- Section about the visualization -->
    <h2 style="font-family: sans-serif; color: #FFFFFF">About the Visualization</h2>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      The model visualization was created using a variety of different tools! For the model canvas grid and cells, I used the p5.js library which can be found <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #61A1EA">here</a>. p5.js is an open-source JavaScript library designed to be accessible and user friendly (p5js ND)! In particular, it has a lot of built-in functionality for drawing and creating complex visual designs. If anything, my visualization just scratches the surface of what can be achieved! For some examples of the many things you can do with p5.js, look <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/" target="_blank" style="color: #61A1EA">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      I also used Plotly.js to create the graph on the right-hand side of the visualization. Plotly.js is another open-source JavaScript library and is optimized for the charting and graphing of data (Plotly 2020). One great thing about Plotly.js is that it fairly easily accommodates interactive and/or live-updating charts. Given this, it was especially useful for my ABM due my need for a responsive dashboard connected to my model canvas. Similar to my use of p5.js, though, Plotly.js has an wealth of functionality that is only briefly explored here. For some examples of cool visualizations you can achieve with Plotly.js, look <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/" target="_blank" style="color: #61A1EA">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p style="color: #FFFFFF">
      Lastly, I wanted to mention two more great resources for building interactive elements for web development that I leveraged to create this webpage: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #61A1EA">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #61A1EA">The Coding Train</a>. W3Schools is a website dedicated to helping individuals learn web development (W3Schools 2020) and is one of the best resources I know for quickly finding how to implement a specific functionality into a site. Do you need buttons, sliders, or a searchable portfolio? W3Schools has tutorials that can get you off the ground quickly! The Coding Train is a fantastic resource for learning p5.js and offers great introductions into more complex tasks such as creating web-based games and designing complex math-based visuals. The Coding Train is the brainchild of Daniel Shiffman – a professor at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts – and can be accessed both from his <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #61A1EA">website</a> or from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/about" target="_blank" style="color: #61A1EA">Youtube channel</a>  (The Coding Train 2020).
